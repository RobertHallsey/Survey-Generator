<h1>Survey Generator</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Survey Generator gives you an easy way to generate, conduct, and summarize the results of custom surveys. </p>

<h2>Files in the Package</h2>
<p>The Survey Generator package contains these files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>readme.md</li>
  <li>documentation.htm</li>
  <li>survey.php</li>
  <li>index.php</li>
  <li>survey.css</l1>
  <li>sample-survey</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use Survey Generator</h2>

<p>Of course, you must first include or require the file <code>survey.php</code> into your own script.</p>

<p>To conduct a survey, use <code>&lt;?php survey_conduct('survey definition file') ?></code> anywhere you want the survey form to appear. The survey definition file is a text file in ordinary Windows INI format that defines a survey's question and answers. The argument can include an absolute or relative file path (not URL). Survey definition files can have any name and extension, and are fully described later.</p>

<p>Survey results are saved in comma-delimited files that can be opened with Excel. They are saved with the same file name and in the same location of the survey definition file, but with the extension <code>csv</code> appended to the name and extension. For example, if your survey definition file is called <code>survey136.txt</code>, its results will accumulate in the file called <code>survey136.txt.csv</code>.

<p>To summarize the results of a survey, use <code>&lt;?php survey_summarize('survey definition file') ?></code>. The <code>survey_summarize()</code> function generates tables summarizing the responses by count and percentage.</p>

<h2>Survey Definition Files</h2>

<p>Open the file <code>sample-survey</code> and take a look at it. Survey definition files contain one or more sections, one for each question or panel of questions in the survey. Each section begins with its name surrounded by square brackets, like <code>[section_1]</code>. Section names must not contain spaces and must be unique. However, section names are not meaningful. They don't have to be sorted nor do they sort themselves nor anything like that. Sections are just grouping mechanisms for the definitions of a question or panel of questions. There are three types of questions.</p>

<h3>Type 1 Question</h3>

<pre><code>[section_1]
type = 1
title = "Preferences"
help = "S=small M=medium L=large"
questions[] = "What size Coke do you prefer?"
questions[] = "What size popcorn do you prefer?"
questions[] = "What size candy bar do you prefer?"
questions[] = "What size T-Shirt do you wear?"
answers[] = "S"
answers[] = "M"
answers[] = "L"</code></pre>

<p>The first line says this is a type 1 question. Type 1 questions consist of a panel of questions, all with the same possible answers. Common applications for this type of question are assessing customer satisfaction with the various aspects of some paid experience, or determining the public's degree of familiarity with a product or concept.</p>

<p>The help property is a message displayed at the top of the questions, to the left of the answer headings. The help property is optional, and only type 1 questions recognize this property. You can't use it with types 2 and 3 questions.</p>

<p>The title property is also optional, but can be used in all three question types. It's a heading that appears before the question. It's optional so that you can group several sections under the same title.</p>

<p>Now comes a list of questions followed by a list of possible answers. Normally, property names must be unique, but the empty brackets mean that it's an array, so the property names will actually become:</p>

<pre><code>questions[0] = "What size Coke do you prefer?"
questions[1] = "What size popcorn do you prefer?"
questions[2] = "What size candy bar do you prefer?"
questions[3] = "What size T-Shirt do you wear?"</code></pre>

<h3>Type 2 Question</h3>

<p>This type of question allows one and only one multiple choice answer.</p>

<pre><code>[section_2]
type = 2
questions[] = "What kind of car do you drive?"
answers[] = "Honda"
answers[] = "Toyota"
answers[] = "Ford"
answers[] = "General Motors"
answers[] = "Other"
answers[] = "I don't drive"</code></pre>

<p>A note on good surveying practice: you should always include a catchall answer. A catchall answer makes it possible for everyone to answer the question. In this case, people who don't drive can select the final possible answer. Otherwise, they would be forced to either select a choice that was not true or abandon the survey. To prevent that, always provide a catchall.</p>

<h3>Type 3 Question</h3>

<p>This is the last survey question type. Like Type 2, it allows one multiple choice question, except people can check all the answers that apply.</p>

<pre>[section_3]
type = 3
questions[] = "Things you like about your job"
answers[] = "Short commute"
answers[] = "Good supervisor"
answers[] = "Good co-workers"
answers[] = "Fulfilling"
answers[] = "High status"
answers[] = "Fun environment"
answers[] = "Pays well"
answers[] = "I don't like my job"</pre>

<p>In the case of Type 3 questions, the last possible answer must always be a catchall answer. Survey takers cannot submit a survey in which responses <i>include</i> the catchall answer. The catchall answer must be selected exclusively or not selected at all.</p>

<h3>Customization</h3>

<p>Should you need to change them, these constants are defined at the very start of the script.</p>
<p><code>SURVEY_RESET_BUTTON</code>:<br>Text of the survey form's reset button, defaults to 'Reset'.</p>
<p><code>SURVEY_SUBMIT_BUTTON</code>:<br>Text of the survey form's submit button, defaults to 'Submit'.</p>
<p><code>SURVEY_RESPONSE_FILE_EXT</code>:<br>File extension for saving data, defaults to 'csv' (no dot).</p>
<p><code>SURVEY_ERROR_NO_RESPONSE</code>:<br>Message returned when form is submitted with unanswered questions, string in sprintf format, defaults to 'Please answer question #%d'.</p>
<p><code>SURVEY_ERROR_EITHER_OR</code>:<br>Message returned when form is submitted with catchall and other answers selected, string in sprintf format, defaults to 'Last option is either/or in question #%d'.</p>

<h3>Styling with CSS</h3>

<p>Survey Generator provides functionality without imposing any look or feel. It leaves the designing to you, the designer. It's <i>your canvas!</i> The included file <code>survey.css</code> can be used as a starting point.</p>
