Survey Generator

Survey Generator gives you an easy way to generate, conduct, and summarize the results of custom surveys. Survey Generator is lightweight, consisting of just one file. It also doesn't use a database. Instead, it saves survey results to files in CSV format, which can be loaded natively into Excel and other applications.
