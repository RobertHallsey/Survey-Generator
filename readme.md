Survey Generator

Survey Generator lets you generate and conduct custom surveys of your design, collecting the results in CSV files.
It's written in PHP, using a procedural style.
It does not use a database.

My biggest challenge, not yet solved to my satisfaction, is preventing the user from hitting the browser's back button, returning to the completed survey form, and re-submitting it a hundred times in short order, basically invalidating the survey results.
