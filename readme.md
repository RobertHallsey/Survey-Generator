Survey Generator

Survey Generator gives you an easy way to generate, conduct, and summarize the results of custom surveys of you design. Survey Generator consists of just one file. It's written in PHP and does not use a database. Instead, survey results are saved in CSV format, which can be loaded as-is into Excel.
